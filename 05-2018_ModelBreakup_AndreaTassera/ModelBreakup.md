Andrea Tassera, Computational Design Manager @ Ridley, teaches how to automatically break up Revit models with the use of Dynamo :rocket:. In this class we see how to break up models by service/discipline (architecture, structure, mechanical, etc.) and by level, to ease the export to Navisworks for coordination.
